### Settings Overview

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Enabled | Toggle auto-greeting on/off | On |
| Emote Command | Emote used for greeting | `/wave` |
| Friends Only | Only greet players on your friends list | Off |
| Target Before Greeting | Target the player before emoting | On |
| Greet Delay | Seconds to wait before greeting | 3s |
| Scan Interval | How often to scan for new players | 3s |
| Greet Range | Distance (yalms) to detect players | 15 |
| Enable Auto-Reply | Reply when someone emotes at you | On |

### Actions

- **Clear Greeted List** — Resets the memory of who you've already greeted, so everyone nearby will be greeted again

## How It Works

1. **Scanning** — WaveKeeper periodically scans for nearby players within your configured range
2. **Greeting** — When a new player is detected, it queues a greeting with your configured delay
3. **Reply Detection** — Uses a game emote hook to detect when someone emotes directly at you
4. **Auto-Reply** — If someone emotes at you and you haven't replied yet, it automatically replies with your configured emote
5. **Cleanup** — Players are removed from the greeted list when they leave the area

## Chat Notifications
